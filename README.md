# `tap-arc`

> A small (~12kB) [TAP](https://testanything.org/) reporter with spec-like output, streaming, and failure diffing.

## Objectives

- minimal, informative spec-like output for all assertions
- minimal, maintained dependencies -- can't be shipping React to CI
- streaming in and out
- helpful diffing for failures

## Installation & Usage

> Compatible with Node.js 12+.

For a JavaScript project, save `tap-arc` as a development dependency:

```sh
npm i -D tap-arc
```

Simply pipe tap output to `tap-arc`.  
Example `npm test` script:

```js
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "test": "tape test/**/*.js | tap-arc"
}
```

> üíÅ  `tap-arc` will format output from any tap reporter. [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape) was used for testing.

Alternatively, use `tap-arc` globally:

```sh
npm i -g tap-arc
```

### `tap-arc --help`

```
Usage:
  tap-arc <options>

Parses TAP data from stdin, and outputs a "spec-like" formatted result.

Options:

  -v | --verbose
    Output full stack trace

  -p | --pessimistic | --bail
    Immediately exit upon encountering a failure
    example: tap-arc -p

  --no-color
    Output without ANSI escape sequences for colors
    example: tap-arc --no-color

  --padding [space, dot, <custom characters>]
    String to use when padding output (default="  ")
    example: tap-arc --padding "‚Ä¢‚Ä¢"
    example: tap-arc --padding dot

  --indent [space, dot, <custom characters>]
    String to use when indenting Object diffs (default="¬∑¬∑")
    example: tap-arc --indent ">>"
    example: tap-arc --indent space
```

## Development

The entirety of the reporter lives in `./index.js`.

When building `tap-arc`, it's helpful to try various TAP outputs. See `package.json` `"scripts"` for useful "tap-arc:*" commands to test passing and failing TAP.

```sh
npm run tap-arc:simple # used to create the screen shot above
```

### Snapshot tests

The main library is snapshot tested (`npm test` loads all snapshots to compare to current output). Create snapshots with the `npm run make-snapshots` commands.

The snapshots are versioned by Node.js' major version, ie. `node14` and `node16`. But snapshots may vary between minor and patch versions of Node. (Line numbers of Node internals shift, causing changes in stack traces.) GitHub's Actions are set to use the latest Node.js 14.x and 16.x, so when testing and creating snapshots locally, do the same.

This is also why `tape` is pinned as a development dependency. Update as needed, but recreate snapshots.

- [tap-difflet](https://github.com/namuol/tap-difflet) inspired output and diffing, also vulnerable
